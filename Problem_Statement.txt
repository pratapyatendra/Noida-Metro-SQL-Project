Problem Statement: Noida Metro Ticket Booking System
=====================================================

Background
-------------------------------------------------
The Noida Metro Rail Corporation (NMRC) requires a simplified ticket booking system to manage passengers, stations, and tickets. 
The system should allow booking tickets using either QR tickets or SmartCards.

-------------------------------------------------
Requirements
-------------------------------------------------
1. Passengers Management
   - Store passenger details such as name, card_type, and balance.
   - By default, new passengers should be assigned a QR Ticket type.
   - Existing passengers may have a SmartCard with a preloaded balance.

2. Stations Management
   - Maintain a list of stations with unique IDs and names.

3. Ticket Booking
   - Passengers book tickets from a start station to an end station.
   - The fare is calculated based on the distance between stations:
     fare = ABS(end_station_id - start_station_id) * 10
   - For SmartCard passengers:
     - Deduct fare from balance.
     - Booking fails if balance is insufficient.
   - For QR Ticket passengers:
     - Fare is charged but not deducted from balance (pay per ride).

4. Booking Record
   - Store every booking in the ticket table with:
     - Ticket ID
     - Passenger ID
     - Start & End station
     - Fare
     - Journey date & time

-------------------------------------------------
Expected Deliverables
-------------------------------------------------
- SQL scripts to create tables, sequences, and sample data.
- PL/SQL procedure ticket_booking_system to handle bookings.
- Proper exception handling (e.g., invalid station names, insufficient balance).
- GitHub repository with:
  - README.txt (documentation)
  - Problem_Statement.txt (this file)
  - .sql script files for schema and procedures

-------------------------------------------------
Success Criteria
-------------------------------------------------
- A user can book a ticket by simply entering:
  - Passenger Name
  - Start Station Name
  - End Station Name
- System automatically:
  - Creates passenger (if new) with default QR card.
  - Calculates and displays fare.
  - Stores ticket booking in the database.
